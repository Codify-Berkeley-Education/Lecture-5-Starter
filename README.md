# Lecture-5-Starter

The completed directory has the entire schema that we will create over the course of lecture, and a few migrations. The completed directory uses bun, but you are free to use any package manager you like in the starter directory

The starter directory is a completely empty folder for you to initialize a package.json, initialize prisma, and create the schema yourself.

There are two important commands to know

1. Open the prisma studio to visually interact with the database >npx prisma studio
2. Sync your database with your schema >npx prisma migrate dev
